### Steps to install

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Create a Next.js project
    ```sh title="terminal"
    npx create-next-app@latest project-name
    ```
    You will be prompted with a series of questions. Select the following options:

    ```sh title="terminal"
    ✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?
    ✔ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? … No
    ✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? … No
    ✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? … No
    ✔ What import alias would you like configured? … @/* … Yes
    ```

    After the project is created, head to the project root:
    ```sh title="terminal"
    cd project-name
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    #### Install packages

    ```package-install
    npm i @govtechmy/myds-react @govtechmy/myds-style
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    #### Configure CSS stylesheet

    You may configure the styling through one of (2) methods listed below.

    __1. CSS import__

    ```css title="app/global.css"
    @import "@govtechmy/myds-style/full.css";
    ```

    __2. Tailwind CSS__

    Please read the [Style Configuration](./style-configuration) for more advanced configuration.

    </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Start using the components!

    Here is a `<Button />` for you to get started!

    ```tsx title="components/button.tsx"
    "use client"; // [!code highlight] For Next App Router, must include this line
    import { Button } from "@govtechmy/myds-react/button";

    export default () => {
      return <Button variant="primary-fill">Hello MYDS</Button>;
    };
    ```

    <Callout
      type="info"
      title="Important"
      className="bg-bg-primary-50 text-txt-primary border-transparent"
      icon={<InfoIcon className="size-5" />}
    >
      MYDS components are built for the client-side, while Next.js App router is
      server rendered by default.

      To tell Next.js to render the component client side, you
      must include the `use client` directive in the component file. For Next.js Page router, you may omit the directive.
    </Callout>


    ```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
    import Button from "../components/button";

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Button />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
