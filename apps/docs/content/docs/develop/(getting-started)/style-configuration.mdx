import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

import { InfoIcon } from "@govtechmy/myds-react/icon";
import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

MYDS stylesheet is composed of various components to cater to a wide range of use cases.
But you might not need everything in your project! Here's how we can be more selective with our imports!

<Callout
  type="warn"
  title="Important"
  className="bg-bg-warning-50 text-txt-warning border-transparent"
  icon={<InfoIcon className="size-5" />}
>
  This section is for advanced styling configuration. If you are content with
  the simple configuration outlined in [Installation](./install?#full-css), you
  may skip this page.

## Foundation

### Fonts

MYDS supports 2 typefaces: `Poppins` & `Inter`. We recommend you to import via a reputable CDN like [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Here's a one-liner CSS import!

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&family=Poppins:ital,wght@0,400;0,500;0,600;1,400;1,500;1,600&display=swap");
```

### Color

We define each color in the MYDS Design Language as a CSS variable, which later becomes the building block to build themes!

```css
@import "@govtechmy/myds-style/color.css";
```

### Theme

MYDS supports both light and dark mode. However, we understand that not all projects require this feature.
So, you can omit importing the unwanted theme from your project!

```css
/* Import Light theme */
@import "@govtechmy/myds-style/light.css";

/* Import Dark theme */
@import "@govtechmy/myds-style/dark.css";
```

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Important"
  className="bg-bg-primary-50 text-txt-primary border-transparent"
  icon={<InfoIcon className="size-5" />}
>
  Please note it is required to support the light mode by default.
</Callout>

## TailwindCSS

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) is a utility-first CSS framework that serves as the bedrock for how MYDS is styled internally.
However, using TailwindCSS is optional at the project level.

If you do use TailwindCSS, MYDS provides the option for developers to extend its powerful features.

### Component

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My project does not use TailwindCSS">
Got it! Just import the following CSS and we're done!
```css
/* Import Full CSS */
@import "@govtechmy/myds-style/full.css";
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My project uses TailwindCSS">
Awesome, we can import the MYDS presets! Also we need to make sure the TailwindCSS is 'aware' of the component library.
  Apply this to your project `tailwind.config.ts`

```ts title="tailwind.config.ts"
import { preset } from "@govtechmy/myds-style";

export default {
  content: [
    "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", // Your own project source files
    "node_modules/@govtechmy/myds-react/dist/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  presets: [preset],
};
```

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Color Token

MYDS has 2 types of color token that developers need to be aware of, which are:

- **Primitive token** - The value of the primitive token is static & insensitive to theme changes.

- **Theme token** - The value of the theme token changes based on the theme applied.

To learn the entire list of primitive & theme tokens available, read the [full configuration](https://github.com/govtechmy/myds/blob/main/packages/style/tailwind.config.js)
