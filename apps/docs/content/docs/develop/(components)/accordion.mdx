    </Accordion>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Collapsible

Use the `collapsible` prop to determine whether all the accordion is collapsible! By default, it is set to `true`. Please note this only works when `type="single"`.

        repository.
      </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
  </Accordion>
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Disabled

The `disabled` prop exists in both `Accordion` and `AccordionItem` components.

Setting `disabled` to `true` in `Accordion` will disable all the `AccordionItem` components, while in `AccordionItem` will disable the respective `AccordionItem`.

<Tabs items={["Preview", "Code"]} defaultValue="Preview">
  <Tab value="Preview" className="not-prose">
