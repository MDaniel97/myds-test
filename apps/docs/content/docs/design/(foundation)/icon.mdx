## Icon design guidelines

### Grid size

Our icons are designed within a **20x20 grid** as the base size. These icons can later be resized to fit any situation.

### Stroke width

Every icon preserves its **1.5px stroke** width (at 20x20 icon size) after being exported as an SVG file, giving developers more flexibility to adjust them in code.

### Sizes

To maintain consistency and visual balance, it is recommended that the stroke width adjust proportionally with the icon size.
