1. **Forms and Instructions**:Place inset text in forms to highlight important instructions, such as deadlines, requirements, or clarifications. This helps guide users without interrupting the flow of the form.
2. **Documentation and Guidelines**: Use inset text to emphasise key takeaways, important rules, or essential information within long pieces of documentation or guidelines. It helps users quickly locate critical points.
3. **Articles or Blog Posts**: In articles, inset text is great for calling out quotes, statistics, or main ideas to ensure readers notice important content without needing to read the entire section.

By using inset text in these scenarios, you can improve readability, highlight important content, and enhance the overall user experience.
