1. **Primary Action Button:** Typically uses the Secondary Button style for important actions related to the callout, such as "Retry", "Save Changes", or "Continue".

## Usage example

### Forms

**Location:** The callout appears when a user performs an action, usually within forms or modals, indicating whether the outcome is a success, error, warning, or information.

**Width:** For the callout’s width, it is usually full-width, adapting to the container or screen size, whether that is a modal, form, or full page. This ensures that the callout is clearly visible to the user.
