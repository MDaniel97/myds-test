Tabs can exist in several states, each providing visual cues to the user about its current status and interaction possibilities.

1. **Default**: The initial state of the tabs when it is ready for user action but not currently interacted with.
2. **Focused**: An element appears when it is selected or active, usually through keyboard navigation (TAB) or a mouse click. This state is crucial for accessibility, helping users identify the currently active element.
3. **Hover**: An element appears when a user moves the mouse pointer over it. This state provides a visual feedback to indicate that the element is interactive.
4. **Active**: Occurs when a user has clicked on the tab component, indicating that the tab is selected.
5. **Active+Focused**: Occurs when a user has clicked again on the active tab component, indicating that the tab is selected and active.
