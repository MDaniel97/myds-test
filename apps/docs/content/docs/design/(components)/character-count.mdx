1. **Text Area Input**: The character count is added to the existing Text Area Input by displaying the character limit as a hint below the input field.
2. **Hint Under**: The hint text below the input dynamically shows the remaining character count.
3. **Counter**: The counter starts in descending order, showing the remaining characters (e.g., 200, 199...0).

## State

![character-count-type.png](/design/character-count-type.png)

1. **Default**: Displays the remaining characters in descending order once user starts typing, such as “200 characters remaining”.
2. **Warning**: When the user is close to the limit, change colour yellow, such as “10 characters left”.
3. **Error**: If the user exceeds the limit, the counter shows negative numbers, such as “-100 characters over the limit”. User won’t be able to submit the form as character limit is part of validation.
