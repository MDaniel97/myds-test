The key elements that define a Breadcrumb’s structure and function.

1. **Parent Page**: Links to the preceding page or section, helping users navigate back through the hierarchy.
2. **Current Page**: Indicates the user’s current location in the navigation path, typically not clickable.
3. **Wrapper**: A container that holds the breadcrumb trail, ensuring consistent spacing and alignment within the layout.

1. **Limit Title Length**: Set a maximum width of 200px for the current page title. If the title exceeds this length, automatically display an ellipsis (e.g., "Long Page Title...") to maintain a clean and organized layout.
