The summary list uses the **`<dt>`** HTML element to display key-value pairs in a clear format. The overall style is borrowed from the Table component.

1. **Key `<dt>`**: The first column displays the item or attribute being described. It acts as a label or identifier for the value in the next column.
2. **Value `<dd>`**: The second column contains the corresponding data or details for each key. This is the main information that the summary list highlights.
3. **Actions (optional) `<dd>`**: The third column, if present, provides interaction options, such as edit or delete, allowing users to take action on specific items in the list.
