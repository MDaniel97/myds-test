1. **Header**: Title of the column, providing clear context for the data beneath.

3. **Tooltip**: Hover on this icon to show tooltips. Useful to explain the role of the table column.
4. **Sort column button**: Initially hidden, this button appears on hover over the column. Clicking it toggles between ascending and descending order for easy data sorting.

6. **Cell for Button**: Contains action buttons aligned left, allowing users to take specific actions for each row.
7. **Cell for Status Pill**: Displays a colour-coded status indicator (pill) aligned left, providing a quick visual reference for the status of each row
